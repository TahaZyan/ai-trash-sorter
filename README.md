# AI Trash Sorter: My Journey into Machine Learning 🗑️♻️

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project represents my first major foray into artificial intelligence and computer vision. I built a complete waste classification system that distinguishes between recyclable and organic materials with 85% accuracy.

## 🚀 My Development Journey

### The Learning Process
- **Starting Point**: Began with minimal AI knowledge but strong curiosity
- **Skills Acquired**: TensorFlow, neural networks, data preprocessing, model evaluation
- **Tools Mastered**: Google Colab, GitHub, Gradio for web deployment

### Technical Challenges & Solutions
**Challenge 1**: Understanding Neural Networks
- **Struggle**: Initially confused by concepts like convolutional layers and activation functions
- **Breakthrough**: Built simple models first, then gradually increased complexity
- **Learning**: Gained intuition for how AI 'sees' patterns in images

**Challenge 2**: Data Preparation
- **Struggle**: Working with 18,000+ images required learning data pipelines
- **Solution**: Implemented image augmentation to improve model generalization
- **Result**: Increased validation accuracy from 70% to 85%

**Challenge 3**: Model Deployment
- **Struggle**: Turning code into a usable web application
- **Solution**: Learned Gradio framework for rapid prototyping
- **Outcome**: Created a public web app anyone can use
